The objective of this program is to facilitate the sizing of laminated structures. 
To achieve this, we implement a progressive failure method defined at the scale of the unidirectional ply, taking into account the degradation of broken plies, while remaining within the hypothesis of plane stresses. 
In the model studied, all plies have the same thickness. 
We examine the case of a quasi-isotropic symmetric laminate [0/45/135/90].
